Also assume that nothing is canon. Though I try to stay true when I can I also like to play around. I highly suggest you listen to the matching song to go along with each chapter. On the Quiet Isle the Elder Brother picked mercilessly at his memories of the Little Bird. So many whys were asked of him. Why did he protect her? Why did he not beat her as the others had? Why did he seek her out above all others the night the water had burned? He denied the truth. He fought it tooth and nail. Like a rabbit caught in a snare he didn’t realize the harder he struggled the tighter the noose became. Choking it poured forth from him one night tears sliding down his face. He loved her!

Ned's family and friends are forcefully gathered in the Capitol to hold trial when Ned bravely demands Trial By Combat. President Snow invents The Hunger Games as a way to kill off all of his political rivals while making an example out of the rebels by airing the Games on national television. But there are some twists. President Snow declares that if the last remaining survivors have the same family name they will all win The Hunger Games be pardoned and return home. But that won't happen he vows. To increase the stakes he throws in some of the Capitol's most vicious criminals such as Ramsay Bolton and The Hound Sandor Clegane to make things interesting.

For example the character of Sansa Tully looks a great deal like an ancestor named Sansa Stark etc. Unfortunately it doesn’t entirely standalone unless you have a great deal of patience for figuring out who a character is and was attached to in the original work (P&W). This is a fic for those who fully believe Season 5 or at least the last half of it did not happen for them AND that somehow/some way King Stannis made it to the Iron Throne and ended up with Sansa Stark as his queen. In other words this is a Regency Stansa sequel for my Stansa Sisters Tommyginger and Spittingfeathers!

Jon Targaryen is the legitimized son of King Rhaegar The First of his Name. A prince in both name and blood. However his position in the royal family is nothing to be envied. The despised son of Lyanna Stark and Rhaegar Targaryen the blame of Robert's Rebellion unfairly falls upon the young prince. Hated by most of the Targaryen loyalists and looked upon with contempt by most of his father's family the young prince's life was quite miserable until he came to Winterfell to live with his mother's family. He finds a strange golden ring a ring that is far more than what it seems. He keeps it thinking it wondrous to behold. However an ancient enemy is stirring in the cold lands north of the Wall. The force directing them is a being that had been locked away ages ago. Only the Prince Who Was Promised can stop this apocalypse and the Ring will be what either dooms or saves Westeros.,English,43194,43194,10/?,177,177,181,181,22,22,9885,9885

It follows the HBO variation that Sansa was forced to marry and endure Ramsay. When a victorious newly widowed King Stannis is told by the bannermen of the North that the condition of their fealty is that Sansa now rid of Ramsay becomes his queen will he realize how difficult it will be for her to do her duty after what she has been through? This is the first thing I started writing after Season 5 episode 6 started the heartbreak that I knew was only going to get worse. I wasn't going to post because I thought no Stansa fan would want to read a fic where what happened in that episode did happen. Still I wanted to play with the idea of how Stannis might be able to eventually make Sansa comfortable with being his queen. My apologies to those who read and believe it doesn't make the grade in doing that. Many thanks to spittingFeathers and LAntoniou for saying they'd read it if I posted it!

Why did he seek her out above all others the night the water had burned? He denied the truth. He fought it tooth and nail.

They will tear a kingdom apart pull a king from his throne and crown another in his place all in the name of the fair stolen maid. It is a tale that comforts men and reassures them. Even though the knight is too late to save his lady he gains a kingdom and a queen even fairer than the maid he lost. But the truth is not so simple. A war is not one story; it is thousands speaking at once. We do not know what the maid thought or the prince’s wife herself a princess by birth. And other ladies too whose parts in this tale are further obscured as often happens when histories are written by men. This is their story. This was their war.","English",111440,111440,"19/25",138,138,124,124,27,27,7772,7772

He rarely mentions her under any other name. In his eyes women are another race strange and unfathomable and whose true motives and thoughts are impenetrable.

What’s the problem?” “She gave me three different types of damned bleach” Jaime sighs. Brienne looks at them and at the ruined laundry – it’s not too bad of a mess after all so she picks a medium-strength one. Then she heads for the detergents rack grabs the right kind of soap and a box of fabric softener. “Here” she says when she comes back. “Soap for whites medium strength bleach and put also some of this. If it fails and you have to put that stuff on just when you’re at home at least it should be comfortable to wear. And put it on sixty degrees it’s plenty enough. For the dark stuff there’s a specific cycle. For colors not higher than forty. And never use bleach if there are no white clothes. Clear?” “Clear. If that PhD doesn’t work out for you you have a future in explaining laundry to other people.” Or: in which they go to the same laundrette while living in the same campus.","English",8347,8347,"1/1",42,42,101,101,16,16,971,971

Two best friends fall in love at university only to be torn apart by demands of family holidays; a MP and his wife rediscover their undimmed love for one another; the head of one of Britain's top corporations struggles with his new role as a single father and has to come to terms with his new and surprising dependence on his second-in-command.

Vzhled Valyrie jména i postavení včetně vládnoucího rodu jsou vymyšlené ovšem některé informace by měly korespondovat s reáliemi z knih. Na konci si můžete přečíst poznámky a seznam postav pokud si nebudete něčím jisti.
